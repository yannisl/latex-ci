# latex-ci

Cloud based testing and continuous integration for LaTeX documents is not common. Most users will either use their local computer or 
use a cloud based service to render their documents.

This is a minimal configuration and set-up to use a github repository, travis-ci for continuous integration and to upload automatically to a cloud storage such as AWS S3.

I don't claim this is the best or the most optimum way of running and testing documents, but it works for me.

## Prerequisites

1.  A Github account a and basic understanding of using Git.
2.  A travis-ci account.
3.  Dowload the travis-cli and install any necessary pre-requisites.
4.  An AWS account.
5.  Keys for your buckets.
